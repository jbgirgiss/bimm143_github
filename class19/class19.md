## Background

Pertussis is a bacterial lung infection also known as whooping cough.
Let’s begin by examing CDC reported case numbers in the US.

``` r
cdc <- data.frame(
                          year = c(1922L,

> Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine?
> Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

The full introduction of mandatory wP (whole-cell) Pertussis
immunization in the mid 1940s lead to a dramatic reduction in case
numbers (from over 200,000 to 100s).

The switch to the aP (newer acellular formalization) coincided with an
increase in Pertussis cases. Although this phenomenon is not clearly
understood, public vaccine hesitancy, bacterial evolution, and a waning
of immunity in children who received the aP vaccine without a subsequent
booster can all help explain this.

The 2020 lock-downs and social distancing measures lead to a decrease in
transmission of the Pertussis bacteria and cases.

## The CMI-PB Project

The mission of CMI-PB is to provide the scientific community with a
comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of Pertussis
booster vaccination.

Website: https://www.cmi-pb.org/

They make their data availavle via JSON format API endpoints - basically
the database tables in a key:value type format like “infancy_vac”:“wP”.
To read this we can use the `read_json()` function from the **jsonlite**
package.

``` r
library(jsonlite)

subject <- read_json(path = "https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v5_1/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE)

head(subject)
```

This breakdown is not particularly representative of the US population -
this is a serious limitation for this study. However, it is still the
largest sample of it’s type ever assembled.

We need to “join” or link these tables with the `subject` table so we
can begin to analyze this data and know who a given Ab sample was
collected from when.

Now let’s join the `ab_titer` table with our `meta` table so we have all
the information about a given Ab measurement.

> Q10. Now using the same procedure join meta with titer data so we can
> further analyze this data in terms of time of visit aP/wP, male/female
> etc.

``` r
abdata <- inner_join(meta, ab_titer)
```

    Joining with `by = join_by(specimen_id)`

``` r
head(abdata)
```

IgG is crucial for long-term immunity and responding to bacterial &
viral infections.

> Q14. What antigens show differences in the level of IgG antibody
> titers recognizing them over time? Why these and not others?

PT, PRN, FHA, and FIM2/3. The antigens demonstrate differences in IgG
antibody titer levels (MFI) over time. They are the components of the
acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine. These antigens show changes—such as PT
levels observed to rise over time, peak around Visit 5, and then
decline—because they are the specific antigenic components delivered in
the Tdap booster vaccination, which serves as a proxy for natural
infection to measure the adaptive immune response. Other antigens, such
as OVA, do not show these significant temporal changes because they are
irrelevant control antigens that are not present in the vaccines, while
DT and TT remain low because the DT and TT antigens generally induce
longer-lasting immunity so they do not exhibit the same post-boost
response.

We can “facet” our plot by wP vs aP

``` r
ggplot(igg) +
  aes(MFI_normalised, antigen, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2) +
  xlim(0,75) +
  theme_bw()
```

    Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range

This plot shows the time course of Pertussis toxin (PT) antibody
responses for a large set of wP (teal color) and aP (red color)
individuals. Levels peak at day 14 and are larger in magnitude for wP
than aP individuals.

There are lots of cool things to explore in this dataset and we needing
coding and biology knowledge to do it effectively - i.e. you guys!!!
